# ‚úÖ Automatic Blind System ‚Äì To-Do List

## üìå PHASE 1: Planning and Architecture

1. **Define System Requirements**
   - [ ] Number of blinds or axes
   - [ ] Type of control (manual button, app, schedule, light sensor, etc.)
   - [ ] Power source: battery or wall adapter
   - [ ] Limit switch or position feedback?

2. **Create Block Diagram**
   - [ ] High-level system diagram (ESP32, A4988, motor, sensors, power, etc.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è PHASE 2: Hardware Development

### 1. Design the PCB
   - [ ] Create schematic in Fusion 360 (ESP32, A4988, connectors, power input, caps)
   - [ ] Route PCB layout
   - [ ] Add mounting holes and edge connectors
   - [ ] Export Gerbers & BOM
   - [ ] Order prototype PCB

### 2. Assemble & Test PCB
   - [ ] Solder components
   - [ ] Verify power delivery
   - [ ] Test motor control with sample code

### 3. Design the Linkage & Enclosure
   - [ ] Measure window/roller blind mechanics
   - [ ] Design **gear/wheel** or pulley to attach to blind shaft
   - [ ] Design **motor mount and PCB enclosure**
   - [ ] Design optional wall plate or mount
   - [ ] Print and test fit

## üß† PHASE 3: Software & Control Logic

### 1. Firmware Development
   - [ ] Set up stepper control (AccelStepper or similar)
   - [ ] Implement open/close commands
   - [ ] Add speed/acceleration tuning
   - [ ] Debounce and handle manual inputs (buttons/switches)
   - [ ] Implement Wi-Fi or Bluetooth control (optional)

### 2. Add Features (Optional)
   - [ ] Timer or schedule-based opening/closing
   - [ ] Light sensor-based automation
   - [ ] OTA firmware updates

## üì≤ PHASE 4: User Interface

- [ ] Basic serial command interface
- [ ] Optional: Web interface (ESPAsyncWebServer)
- [ ] Optional: Phone app or Home Assistant integration

---

## üìò PHASE 5: Documentation & Finalization

### 1. Documentation
   - [ ] README with system overview
   - [ ] Wiring diagrams and board pinout
   - [ ] Firmware usage guide
   - [ ] Enclosure assembly instructions

### 2. Repository Cleanup
   - [ ] Organize folder structure
   - [ ] Finalize `.gitignore`, LICENSE, and documentation
   - [ ] Create release or tag
